# Setup

### Blac <3 React

Blac has a minimal boilerplate to get you started, all you need is one file to initialize and configure *Blac*:
```ts title="state.ts"
import { BlacReact } from "blac";

const state = new BlacReact([]);  
export const { useBloc } = state;
```

As you can see, only three lines are needed to initialize *Blac* and get access to the `useBloc` hook.

Import this initialization file in your app, make sure this runs before accessing the state in your app, for react it is recommended to do this in `index.tsx`:
```tsx title="index.tsx"
import './state';
```

Thats it, you you just need to create a [Bloc](/docs/blac-core/bloc-basics) or a [Cubit](/docs/blac-core/cubit-basics) and use it in your app.

## Configuring Blac
The `Blac` class takes two arguments, the first is an array of Blocs, the second is the `ConsumerOptions`.
