# Quickstart

Here we go, lets get *Blac* running in under five minutes!

### Overview
There are three parts to *Blac*:

##### 1. Data Layer
> Where the data comes from

##### 2. The Component
> *Blac* is based on the BLoC pattern, which stands for **Business Logic Component**. Think of this as a reusable component that handles state and logic.

##### 3. The UI
> Use the state to render a view.


The BLoC Pattern tries to separate the business logic from the view as much as possible and act as a broker between the UI and the Data Layer.


## Hands on

Install *Blac* with your favorite package manager

```bash
npm i blac
```

### Create a Cubit
A Cubit is a **Business Logic Component**. It is a **stateful** object that handles contains the current state and methods related to it.

```ts {7} title="src/state/CounterCubit.ts"
import { Cubit } from 'blac';

export default class CounterCubit extends Cubit<number> {
  // define a method we can use later in our UI
  public readonly increment = (): void => {
    // Update the state with the `emit` method
    this.emit(this.state + 1);
  }
}  
```

### Create a new *Blac* instance
also export the `useBlac` hook for later use in the react component

```ts {5-7,9} title="src/state/state.ts"
import { BlacReact } from 'blac';
import CounterCubit from './CounterCubit';

// this is your global state
const state = new BlacReact([
  new CounterCubit(0)
]);  

export const { useBlac } = state;  
```

### Use the Cubit in react
The simplest way to acess your state is with the `useBlac` hook, just reference the Cubit we created before.

```ts {6,7} title="src/components/Counter.tsx"
import { useBloc } from 'src/state/state';
import CounterCubit from 'src/state/CounterCubit';

const Counter: FC = (): ReactElement => {
  // useBloc returns the [state, cubit-class] as a "tuple"
  const [state, { increment }] = useBloc(CounterCubit);
  return <button onClick={() => increment()}>Count is: {state}</button>;
}
```
